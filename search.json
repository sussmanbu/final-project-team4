    "text": "Advanced Statistical Analysis\nWe began by collecting a variety of datasets that included PISA scores, literacy rates, and educational completion statistics from multiple sources. The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, standardizing measurement scales, and merging multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis. The R code below illustrates a part of our data cleaning process:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.1.1 ──\n✔ broom        1.0.5     ✔ rsample      1.2.0\n✔ dials        1.2.0     ✔ tune         1.1.2\n✔ infer        1.0.5     ✔ workflows    1.1.3\n✔ modeldata    1.2.0     ✔ workflowsets 1.0.1\n✔ parsnip      1.1.1     ✔ yardstick    1.2.0\n✔ recipes      1.0.9     \n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ scales::discard() masks purrr::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()   masks stats::filter()\n✖ recipes::fixed()  masks stringr::fixed()\n✖ dplyr::lag()      masks stats::lag()\n✖ yardstick::spec() masks readr::spec()\n✖ recipes::step()   masks stats::step()\n• Search for functions across packages at https://www.tidymodels.org/find/\n\nlibrary(broom)\nliteracy &lt;- read_csv('dataset/literacy.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)\nliteracy_clean &lt;- literacy |&gt;\n  filter(Age == '15+', Gender == 'total') |&gt;\n  group_by(Country) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_literacy_rate = mean(`Literacy rate`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) With the cleaned data, we conducted an exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and variance within our data. This included visualizations like histograms and box plots to capture the spread and outliers of literacy rates and educational attainment across continents.\nggplot(literacy_clean, aes(x = continent, y = mean_literacy_rate)) + geom_boxplot()\nTrend Identification Using statistical models, we identified trends in the data, such as the correlation between literacy rates and GDP per capita. We employed linear regression models to understand these relationships, adjusting for potential confounders like urbanization and public education spending.\nmodel &lt;- lm(literacy_rate ~ GDP_per_capita + Urbanization, data = dataset) summary(model)\nDeep Analysis Using Regression Techniques To delve deeper, we used multiple regression techniques to parse out the effects of various socio-economic indicators on educational outcomes. This allowed us to pinpoint the specific factors that most significantly impact education levels.\ncomplex_model &lt;- lm(education_outcome ~ GDP_per_capita + Government_spending + Urbanization, data = dataset) summary(complex_model)\n\n\nKey Findings Our analysis revealed several key insights:\nRegional Variance: There is significant variance in educational outcomes between continents, with factors like economic stability and government policy playing crucial roles.\nSocio-economic Impact: Higher GDP per capita and increased urbanization are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This week we found two datasets to merge our original dataset with.\n1.) The first data set that we are merging with is a dataset that includes more specific world regions. Our original dataset only contains 9 different regions (look at the data_example dataframe below). The dataset that we are merging with (named continent_example) contains 17 different regions, which makes our analysis more specified. The original dataset grouped Central and Southern Asia together, and the new dataset does not do this, which allows us to find more differences within countries. This dataset was found from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/country-mapping-iso-continent-region.\n2.) The second dataset that we are merging with is a PISA dataset that contains PISA scores from countries all over the world. PISA is a standardized exam that is taken all around the world. Knowing these scores will allow us to make more exciting and interesting models that may provide more insight into the disparties between countries. What is cool about this dataset is that it contains the overall PISA score, but also the breakdowns. For example, it contains each country’s overall score, as well as each country’s math, science, and reading score. The downside of this dataset is that it does not contain scores from African countries. This dataset was found from this link: https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/.\nThese are the two datasets that we have merged our original datset; however, there are a few more datasets that we are considering. We want to merge our dataset with some sort of teacher salary dataset as that may provide some insight into why the PISA scores are the way they are. Additionaly, we want to add years to the PISA scores. We only included PISA scores from 2022, and it may be interesting to include PISA scores from specific years.\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/country-mapping-iso-continent-region\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidymodels))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(broom))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv('dataset/educ.csv')\n\nRows: 212969 Columns: 86\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (14): iso_code, region_group, income_group, country, survey, level, cate...\ndbl (72): year, grade, comp_prim_v2_m, comp_lowsec_v2_m, comp_upsec_v2_m, co...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ncontinent &lt;- read_csv('dataset/continents2.csv')\n\nRows: 249 Columns: 11\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (7): name, alpha-2, alpha-3, iso_3166-2, region, sub-region, intermediat...\ndbl (4): country-code, region-code, sub-region-code, intermediate-region-code\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\npisa &lt;- read_csv('dataset/pisa-scores-by-country-2024.csv')\n\nRows: 81 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): country\ndbl (5): OverallPisaScore2022, PISAScoresMathScore2022, PISAScoresScienceSco...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ndata_example &lt;- data |&gt; group_by(region_group) |&gt; slice_head(n = 1) \ndata_example\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 86\n# Groups:   region_group [8]\n  iso_code region_group   income_group country survey  year level grade category\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 AFG      Central and S… Low income … Afghan… DHS     2015 &lt;NA&gt;     NA Ethnici…\n2 CHN      Eastern and S… Upper middl… China   CFPS    2010 &lt;NA&gt;     NA Ethnici…\n3 ALB      Europe and No… Upper middl… Albania DHS     2009 &lt;NA&gt;     NA Ethnici…\n4 ARG      Latin America… Upper middl… Argent… EPH     2004 &lt;NA&gt;     NA Region  \n5 ARE      Northern Afri… High income… U.

The linear regression model below examines the relationship betwee the PISA math score, and factors such as primary school completition rate, % of people not in primary school, mean education years for 20-24 yera olds, and % of people who attend higher education. From the coefficients it seems that all of these factors have a positive linear relationship with the PISA math score. However, the mean education years for 20-24 year olds has a negative relationship which is not what we would expect. This may be due to some sort of colinearity or homoscedacity, which we plan to examine in this coming week.\n\nlm_model &lt;- \n  linear_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nlm_form_fit2 &lt;- \n  lm_model |&gt; \n  fit(pisa_math_mean ~ mean_primary_completion_rate + percent_people_not_in_primary_school + mean_educ_years_20_24 + attend_higher_education, data = pisa_summary)\n\nlm_form_fit2\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = pisa_math_mean ~ mean_primary_completion_rate + \n    percent_people_not_in_primary_school + mean_educ_years_20_24 + \n    attend_higher_education, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                         (Intercept)          mean_primary_completion_rate  \n                              231.47                                339.55  \npercent_people_not_in_primary_school                 mean_educ_years_20_24  \n                               22.55                                -17.28  \n             attend_higher_education  \n                              201.50  \n\n\nHere, we can see that the r^2 value is 0.353 which is not a super high r^2 value, so we will continue to refine our modeling in the coming week.\n\nbroom::glance(lm_form_fit2)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0.353         0.201  40.2      2.32  0.0988     4  -110.  231.  238.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\nbroom::augment(lm_form_fit2, new_data = pisa_summary)\n\n# A tibble: 69 × 13\n   .pred .resid country    mean_primary_completion_rate obs_primary_completion…¹\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                             &lt;dbl&gt;                    &lt;int&gt;\n 1  418.  -42.3 Albania                           0.974                      230\n 2  447.  -41.3 Argentina                         0.963                      453\n 3  NaN   NaN   Australia                         0.993                       87\n 4  NaN   NaN   Austria                         NaN                            0\n 5  406.  -26.1 Azerbaijan                        0.975                      157\n 6  NaN   NaN   Belgium                         NaN                            0\n 7  379.   24.2 Brazil                            0.811                     4085\n 8  NaN   NaN   Bulgaria                        NaN                            0\n 9  360.  -12.5 Cambodia                          0.616                      851\n10  NaN   NaN   Canada                            0.997                       97\n# ℹ 59 more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​obs_primary_completion_rate\n# ℹ 8 more variables: percent_people_not_in_primary_school &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   mean_educ_years_20_24 &lt;dbl&gt;, attend_higher_education &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   number_complete_prim_1524 &lt;dbl&gt;, pisa_overall_mean &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   pisa_math_mean &lt;dbl&gt;, pisa_science_mean &lt;dbl&gt;, pisa_reading_mean &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "Data Visualizing Approach\nAfter cleaning/grouping the data, we took a deeper look to understand the data set by visualized the data in different graph to catch the pattern.\n\nThis graph shows the proportion of people in NORTH AFRICA who have completed primary school. It is interesting how people in Urban areas have a slightly higher completion rate as I would expect people in urban areas to have a lower completion rate. It is also worth noting that the NA bar is near the proportion of the Rural bar which suggests that most of the NA probably would fall into the Rural bar.\n\nThis graph is the same as the one above but for SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. Here, overall, the proportions are lower which implies that education in sub-saharan Africa is not as good as education in Northern Africa. Also, there is a bigger difference between the urban and rural bar here.\n\nThis graph shows the mean primary completion rate for all of the North African countries.\n\nThis graph shows the mean primary school completion rate of all sub-saharan African countries. \n\nThis shows the number of observations for each Latin American country. It is definitely worth noting that countries like LCA and BRB do not have nearly as much data as the other countries. This should be noted for the entirety of our project.\n\nThis is a quick linear regression model we made. There is a relatively strong linear relationships between mean education years for 20-24 year olds and the mean primary completion rate. Note that this is grouped by country. The r-square is 0.72999 which indicated our model relative strong.\n\nThis is a residual plot. The residuals are relatively randomly distributed around y= 0, which means our model is doing a pretty good job of fitting the data. However, it is definitely worth noting that this is an extremely simple 1 variable and our models will require a lot more fine-tuning when they get more advanced."

    "text": "Dataset 1:Weekly United States COVID-19 Racial Data By State, April 12, 2020 to March 7, 2021\nURL: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.7272/Q6TT4P68\nThe dataset contains 212,969 rows and 86 columns.The dataset in question originates from a joint effort by the COVID Tracking Project and Boston University’s Center for Antiracist Research. It has been actively compiled since April 12, 2020, with updates being made twice weekly. The data is sourced from the official public health websites of various states and territories, with the collection process being carried out by volunteers, whose names have been provided. The dataset comprises 54 columns and includes 5320 data points. One notable limitation of the dataset is the inconsistency in reporting the ethnicity data across different states, particularly regarding the categorization of Hispanic or Latino races—some states include this data while others do not. There are 13 columns dedicated to documenting COVID-19 cases across different ethnicities, but there are redundancies, such as the columns for Cases_Latinx and Cases_Ethnicity_Hispanic, which appear to contain similar, if not identical, data. Additionally, the dataset includes 13 columns each for deaths, hospitalizations, and total cases, all disaggregated by ethnicity. However, these sections have many missing entries, which could pose challenges for data cleaning and further analysis.\nQuestions want to answer based on the dataset: -Does the hospitalizations rate affect the deaths rate? -Which ethnicity or group of ethnicities has the highest deaths rate? - Is there a correlation between the hospitalization rate and the death rate due to COVID-19, and if so, how strong is this relationship? -Does the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 differ significantly among ethnic groups, and what might this reveal about access to healthcare or disease severity? - How have hospitalization and death rates evolved over time for each ethnicity, and are there noticeable trends or patterns? - Are there regional variations in the death and hospitalization rates among different ethnicities, and what might this indicate about local public health policies?\nDataset 2: Ethnicity disparities in school in United States URL: https://www.education-inequalities.org/countries/united-states The dataset provided by the World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) tracks educational disparities across various countries, including the United States. From the 212,969 rows and 86 columns, it provides data on education outcomes differentiated by wealth, gender, ethnicity, and location, among other factors. This database can be significant for analyzing racial disparities in education. Meanwhile, the dataset provides numerous variables such as income, region, and completions of education which enable us to perform variable selection to find the best variable to show the correlation between racial disparities and education. We will likely face difficulties while cleaning the data since the dataset is relatively large with numerous outliers. Question want to answer based on the dataset: -How do educational outcomes vary by region and demographic groups in the USA?\n-How have educational outcomes been affected by race in the dataset?\nDataset 3: US Police Shootings URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings?resource=download There are 4896 rows and 15 columns for this dataset. This data was collected from Kaggle amidst the covid 19 pandemic when many hate crimes directed towards specific races were happening. The dataset is consisted of 4896 rows and 15 columns.One challenge that we may face with this dataset is that it is on the smaller side. 5,000 rows is not necessarily small, but it is definitely not large either. If we want to conduct a very reliable study, it may be worth considering finding a dataset with more rows. Another problem that we may run into is that it will be difficult to assess whether a police killing was justified or not if we do not have more description on the crime. For example, if there was a column that described how long the altercation lasted, it may provide more insight into whether or not the crime was justified.\nQuestions want to answer based on the dataset: -Does race and age play a factor in who gets killed by the police? -How are the shooting crime related to the race and age group"

    "text": "Section 1.1: Data Background\nOur team utilized three main datasets for our analysis:\nWorld Inequality Database on Education (WIDE): Available at the World Inequality Database on Education, the WIDE database compiles data from various reliable surveys and assessments, offering insights into the impact of different inequality factors on educational outcomes. Its goal is to highlight significant educational disparities across and within countries to aid in policy-making and public discourse. This dataset was found from this link: https://www.education-inequalities.org/about.\nCountry Mapping - ISO, Continent, Region: This dataset was obtained from Kaggle, a platform offering a wide range of free data resources. It was created for mapping countries in the dataset creator’s analysis, and she permits its free use. The variables in this dataset are straightforward, naming countries with their ISO codes and categorizing them into different continents, regions, and sub-regions. For instance, Afghanistan is represented as AFG - Asia - Southern Asia. This dataset was found from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/country-mapping-iso-continent-region.\nPISA Scores by Country 2024: Sourced from the World Population Review, this dataset is part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). PISA assesses the educational performance of 15-year-old students across approximately 80 countries through a two-hour test focused on science, reading, and mathematics. The dataset provides average scores in these subjects, reflecting the educational standards and economic success indicators of the participating countries. This dataset was found from this link: https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/.\n\n\nSection 1.2: Potential Limitations\nOur dataset is a massive dataset with tens of thousands of rows of data which allows for a comprehensive analysis, but the data also has a lot of missing data. This missing data may leave holes in our analysis, or limit what is possible for us.\n\n\nSection 1.3: Relevant Variables\nThe following are the relevant variables for the chosen dataset.\nWIDE dataset:\n-literacy_1524_no: Percentage of young people aged 15‐24 who can read a simple sentence.\n-comp_prim_v2_m: Percentage of (i) children and young people aged 3‐5 years above primary school graduation age and (ii) young people aged 15‐24 years, who have completed primary school.\n-eduyears_2024_m: Average number of years of schooling attained for the age group 20–24 years.\n-eduout_prim_m: Percentage of children of primary school age who are not in school.\n-comp_lowsec_v2_m: Percentage of (i) young people aged 3‐5 years above lower secondary school graduation age and (ii) young people aged 15‐24 years, who have completed lower secondary school.\n-preschool_3_no: Percentage of 3 to 4 year olds attending any type of pre–primary education programm.\nCountry Mapping Dataset:\n-name: Names of the country.\n-region: The continent in which the country is located.\n-sub-region: The specific region of the continent in which the country is located.\nPISA Dataset\n-OverallPisaScore2022: Total Pisa scores of the country in 2022.\n-PISAScoresMathScore2022: The Pisa scores in math of the country in 2022.\n-PISAScoresScienceScore2022: The Pisa scores in science of the country in 2022.\n-PISAScoresReadingScore2022: The Pisa scores in reading of the country in 2022.\n\n\nSection 2: Data Cleaning and Merging\nclean_script\nData Cleaning\nOur data cleaning mostly consisted of renaming column names so that it is easier for our data to merge.\nData Merging\nThe first data set that we are merging with is a dataset that includes more specific world regions. Our original dataset only contains 9 different regions (look at the data_example dataframe below). The dataset that we are merging with (named continent_example) contains 17 different regions, which makes our analysis more specified. The original dataset grouped Central and Southern Asia together, and the new dataset does not do this, which allows us to find more differences within countries.\nThe second dataset that we are merging with is a PISA dataset that contains PISA scores from countries all over the world. PISA is a standardized exam that is taken all around the world. Knowing these scores will allow us to make more exciting and interesting models that may provide more insight into the disparities between countries. What is cool about this dataset is that it contains the overall PISA score, but also the breakdowns. For example, it contains each country’s overall score, as well as each country’s math, science, and reading score. The downside of this dataset is that it does not contain scores from a lot African countries.\n\n\nSection 3: R Libraries\nThe libraries we use:\n-tidyverse - A collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization.\n-tidymodels - A suite for modern and tidy statistical modeling.\n-broom - Converts statistical analysis objects into tidy format.\n-scales - For formatting and manipulating axis labels and color scales in plots.\n-patchwork - Facilitates the combination of multiple ggplot2 plots into one.\n-knitr - Enables dynamic report generation integrating R code with text.\n-stringr - Provides easy-to-use functions for string operations.\n-car - Offers tools for regression diagnostics and other statistical tests.\n-caret - Focuses on training and tuning machine learning models."

Compared to the baseline of Africa as the reference category, all other regions (Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America) show a positive association with lower secondary completion rates. To explain the association toward the response variable, I will provide an example. For the coefficient of 0.123 for Asia: This means that, compared to Africa, being in the region of Asia is associated with an average increase in the lower secondary completion rates by 0.123 units. Since the region of Africa is the baseline, and its association with all other region is positive, so we can conclude that being in Africa will have the lowest lower-secondary completion rate compared to other regions. And the significance is indicated by the p-value that is smaller than 0.05.\n3) Urban locations have a positive coefficient, indicating that being in an urban location is associated with higher secondary completion rates compared to rural locations.\n4) Sex does not seem to be a significant predictor, as the coefficient for males is small and not statistically significant (p-value &gt; 0.05).\n5) Wealth shows a strong positive association with lower secondary completion. As wealth quintiles increase, there’s a corresponding significant increase in the completion rates, with the highest quintile (Quintile 5) having the largest coefficient.\n6) The comp_prim_v2_m variable has a large positive coefficient, indicating a strong association with higher rates of lower secondary completion.\n7) The adjusted R-squared is 0.8509, indicating a good fit even after adjusting for the number of predictors.\n8) The F-statistic is very high, and the associated p-value is less than 0.001, suggesting the model is statistically significant.\n\n\nSection 2.1.3: Model1 Conclusion\nThe R-squared is 0.8509, and the vif shows that there is no collinearity between predictors. We will remove the predictor of “sex” from the mode because of insignificance indicated by p-value higher than 0.05. Finally, being in the region of Africa, being in the location of rural area, and staying in the lower wealth level will negatively influence the secondary education completion. And the high primary education completion will positively affect the secondary education completion rate."

Europe has an even higher positive coefficient (616.8468), indicating a stronger association compared to the Africa region than Asia. North America and South America also have positive coefficients, but the impact is less compared to Asia and Europe. The coefficients for regions are statistically significant except for South America (p-value &gt; 0.05).\n2) Wealth quintiles show a gradient of increasing positive coefficients from Quintile 2 to Quintile 5, suggesting that as wealth increases, the dependent variable also increases. Quintile 5 has a particularly high coefficient, and the effects for Quintile 4 and Quintile 5 are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01).\n3) The variable edu2_2024_no has a very high positive coefficient (2424.4635), indicating a strong and statistically significant association with the dependent variable.\n4) The preschool variable (preschool_3_no) has a small but statistically significant positive coefficient, indicating that an increase in this variable is associated with an increase in the dependent variable.\n5) The model has a relatively high R-squared value of 0.7265, meaning approximately 72.65% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model, indicating a good fit.\n6) The F-statistic is very large, and the p-value is less than 0.001, suggesting that the model is highly statistically significant.\n\n\nSection 2.2.3: Model2 Conclusion\nThe R-squared is 0.7208, and the vif shows that there is no collinearity between predictors. We will remove the predictors that have the insignificance indicated by p-value higher than 0.05 from the model. In summary, being in the region of Africa and South America, or staying in the lower wealth level will negatively influence the secondary education completion. And the higher rate of attending pre-primary institution will positively affect the secondary education completion rate. However, an interetsing finding is that less than two years schooling can also increase the percentage of young people aged 15‐24 who can read a simple sentence. We could conduct further analysis on this relationship."

    "section": "What did we find?",
    "text": "What did we find?\n\nAfrica was the worst perfromer by almost every metric\nWe looked at many metrics that all aim to measure the education level of a country in some capacity. This includes PISA scores, literacy rates, primary school completion rate, mean years of education, etc. What we noticed in essentially all of these metrics that Africa was the worst performer in every category. However, the concerning part is that it was not even close. Africa consistently lagged behind the rest of the continents.\n\n\nWhile Africa is the worst performer, Northern Africa is performing a lot better than Sub-Saharan Africa.\nWhen analyzing the primary school completion rate for Africa as a continent, we found that as the worst performer by far. But when we took a deeper dive, we found that Northern Africa was actually on par with the rest of the world in terms of this metric, where as Sub-Saharan Africa significantly lagged behind the rest of the world. This is true for many other metrics as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean? Common perception tells us that Africa as a continent is behind in education, but that statement is only partially correct. When breaking down these metrics by region rather than continent, we can tell that This is more of a Sub-Saharan African issue rather than an African issue. Many countries in Africa, such as Nauru (NER), Chad (TCD), and Libera (LBR), have less than 25% of their kids complete primary school, which is a shockingly low number. Rather than labeling Africa continent that is behind in terms of quality education, we should be more-so focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa as a region that needs better education.\n\n\nKeep your kids in school at all costs\nMuch of our analysis was focused on metrics involved with staying in school. Metrics such as primary school completion rate, mean years of education, percentage of people not in school, etc, all fall into this category. We have also analyzed benchmark metrics such as academic achievement, literacy rates, and PISA scores. Our analysis makes it clear that there is an extremely strong correlation between these schooling metrics such as primary school completion rate and mean years of education, and the benchmark metrics such as PISA scores and literacy rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean? This plot tells us that how long you stay in school is directly correlated with a benchmark metric such as literacy rate. The number one most important thing when it comes to school is that you are at least attending school. Of course doing well and getting good grades should be a big goal too, but attending school in the first place is extremely important.\n\n\nEurope is doing a great job and the world should model after them\nOn the other side of things, we noticed that Europe was the best performing continent in almost every metric. The surprising part is that Europe does not really have any countries that are significantly behind any other countries. In section 1.5 of our analysis, we looked at the worst 3 countries in each continent for each metric, and Europe’s “worst” countries still outperformed the average countries in other continents. For example, when analyzing the primary school completion rate, the country with the lowest completion rate in Europe, Albania, still had a rate of 0.97, which is significantly higher than every other country in that table.\n\n\n\n\n\nregion\ncountry\nPrimary School Completion Rate\nrank\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\nLiberia\n0.2291407\n1\n\n\nAfrica\nNiger\n0.2348941\n2\n\n\nAfrica\nChad\n0.2350572\n3\n\n\nAsia\nAfghanistan\n0.5104556\n1\n\n\nAsia\nPakistan\n0.5843212\n2\n\n\nAsia\nCambodia\n0.6162612\n3\n\n\nEurope\nAlbania\n0.9742778\n1\n\n\nEurope\nMontenegro\n0.9898302\n2\n\n\nEurope\nSerbia\n0.9959805\n3\n\n\nNorth America\nHaiti\n0.3944480\n1\n\n\nNorth America\nGuatemala\n0.6732015\n2\n\n\nNorth America\nNicaragua\n0.6776326\n3\n\n\nOceania\nVanuatu\n0.8169209\n1\n\n\nOceania\nKiribati\n0.9467611\n2\n\n\nOceania\nFiji\n0.9874556\n3\n\n\nSouth America\nSuriname\n0.8031490\n1\n\n\nSouth America\nBrazil\n0.8113292\n2\n\n\nSouth America\nParaguay\n0.8799102\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean? This tells us that the world could benefit form modeling its education systems after Europe. European education systems typically receive substantial government funding, which ensures high quality teaching and resources.\n\n\nImpact of Geographic and Socioeconomic Factors on Secondary Education Completion\nOur statistical modeling has revealed critical insights into the factors influencing secondary education completion rates, particularly in the regions of Africa and South America. Findings indicate that residing in rural areas, being in lower wealth brackets, and being located in Africa significantly hinder secondary education achievement. Conversely, high rates of primary education completion have been shown to positively impact secondary education success.\nFurthermore, the attendance at pre-primary institutions also boosts secondary education completion rates, demonstrating the importance of early childhood education. Interestingly, a surprising trend was observed where less than two years of schooling could still enhance literacy among youth aged 15-24, enabling them to read simple sentences. This intriguing correlation suggests that even minimal education can contribute to basic literacy skills, though further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.\nSo what does this mean? These insights are crucial for policymakers and educational organizations aiming to improve education systems and tailor interventions that support educational attainment across varying socioeconomic and geographic landscapes."

    "text": "Data for Equity:\nThe definition of beneficence in the “Principles for Advancing Equitable Data Practice”, basically call people in data processing to maximize benefits for all human beings and avoid causing harm. In our project, we want to discuss the relationship between race and education. Recognizing our topic is full of sensitivity and complexity, we will ensure our analysis is fair without reinforcing any stereotypes to some races and regions. In order to follow beneficence, we will be meticulous in how data is interpreted and presented, and avoid making incorrect or harmful interpretations. Our data set we chose actually aligns with the principles. For example, the original data can be accessed through the websites of the Global Education Monitoring Report and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The website is accessible for all communities and it follows the principle of justice: return data and research results to community members in a form they can use. Concurrently, it also meets transparency, because to adhere to this principle, it would entail providing comprehensive metadata and ensuring easy access to data documentation. However, our dataset encompasses numerous variables, not all of which are pertinent to our analysis.  The presence of superfluous information poses a risk of leading to incorrect conclusions or oversimplifications. Additionally, there may be challenges due to our limited capacity to fully analyze the breadth of data available. By acknowledging these limitations and proceeding with caution, we aim to uphold the principles throughout our research."

In our previous posts, we have only use simply region and elementary education level and building simple regression just to see whether the data make sense to us. After verifying the potential answer we will get, we also want to add our variable to help building the regression.\nOur analysis sought to reveal the mean years of education across different categorizations such as location (urban vs. rural), sex (male vs. female), and more. Utilizing ggplot2, we visualized these differences, which unveiled significant disparities. For instance, urban areas consistently showed higher educational attainment than rural counterparts, with Europe leading in educational years and Africa lagging behind."
