A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

World Inequality Database on Education Wefound a data set that is related to education vs race. Then we found that the data set can track educational disparities across various countries, including the United States. Specifically, the data originates from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and other national household surveys and learning assessments across over 170 countries. The World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) serves as a rich and free repository of data sourced from a variety of reliable surveys and assessments, providing insights into how educational outcomes are influenced by different factors of inequality. It hopes to draw attention to unacceptable levels of education inequality across countries and between groups within countries, to help to inform policy design and public debate.\nWe used two datasets so far. We mainly focused on the education dataset which includes many education-related variables that are used to assess various aspects of educational attainment and attendance rates across different levels of schooling, from pre-primary to upper-secondary education. Variables and their definitions: Pre‐primary education attendance: Percentage of 3 to 4 year olds attending any type of pre–primary education programme. Never been to school: Percentage of children aged 3‐6 years above primary school entrance age who have never been to school. Over‐age primary school attendance: Percentage of children in primary school who are at least two years older than the official age for grade. Out‐of‐school children: Percentage of children of primary school age who are not in school. Primary completion rate: Percentage of (i) children and young people aged 3‐5 years above primary school graduation age and (ii) young people aged 15‐24 years, who have completed primary school. Transition rate to lower secondary school: Number of young people attending the first grade of lower secondary school as a percentage of those attending the final grade of primary school. Out‐of‐school adolescents: Percentage of adolescents of lower secondary school age who are not in school. Lower secondary completion rate: Percentage of (i) young people aged 3‐5 years above lower secondary school graduation age and (ii) young people aged 15‐24 years, who have completed lower secondary school. Transition rate to upper secondary school: Number of young people attending the first grade of upper secondary school as a percentage of those attending the final grade of lower secondary school. Out‐of‐school youth: Percentage of youth of upper secondary school age who are not in school. Upper secondary completion rate: Percentage of (i) young people aged 3‐5 years above upper secondary school graduation age and (ii) people aged 20‐29 years, who have completed upper secondary school. Tertiary completion rate: Percentage of people aged 25‐29 years, who have completed at least four years of higher education. Less than 2 years of schooling: Percentage of the population living in extreme education poverty: with less than two years of education for the age group 20‐24 years. Less than 4 years of schooling: Percentage of the population living in education poverty: with less than four years of education for the age group 20‐24 years. Mean years of education: Average number of years of schooling attained for the age group 20–24 years.\nOur data is mainly focused on education access and completion conditions by categorizing different demographics such as sex, ethnicity, location, region, wealth, and speaking language at home. The data also combined those categories to narrow down the group and get the education data. For example, we had the category of “Location & Sex,” which groups data with either Rural or Urban, each further grouped by either female or male. Thus, we have four different groups of data: Rural-Female, Rural-Male, Urban-Female, and Urban-Male. However, to avoid overfitting the model or processing duplicate data, we may filter the data by a single category of either one of the “Location”, ”Sex”, “Ethnicity”, ”Region”, and “Wealth,” discarding other combined ones. For response value, we will keep those variables about the access and completion rate and remove those indicators about learning indicators such as learning achievement in reading/mathematics/science because there are a lot of missing values.\nFor future analysis of education based on race, we also used another dataset that contains the name of the country, the country code, the central region (e.g. Asia), and its sub-region (e.g. Southern Asia) in order to regroup the area in the education dataset. the area in the education data set.\n\n\nData loading and grouping\nclean_script\nThe libraries we use:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(broom)\n\nTo enhance our data preparation process, we plan to refine the regional categorization within our dataset. Initially, we identified that the ‘region’ column unexpectedly amalgamated diverse regions, such as combining Europe with North America and East with Southeast Asia. To address this, we will adopt a strategy to split the data more accurately according to geographic regions. We have sourced an additional dataset that delineates regions and continents more distinctly. By integrating this new dataset with our original data, we will reorganize the regional variables for clearer segmentation. Following these adjustments, we will conduct data visualization on the newly grouped data. This step will facilitate a deeper understanding and provide clearer insights by representing the data in a visually intuitive manner.

    "text": "Data Visualizing Approach\nAfter cleaning/grouping the data, we took a deeper look to understand the data set by visualized the data in different graph to catch the pattern.\n\nThis graph shows the proportion of people in NORTH AFRICA who have completed primary school. It is interesting how people in Urban areas have a slightly higher completion rate as I would expect people in urban areas to have a lower completion rate. It is also worth noting that the NA bar is near the proportion of the Rural bar which suggests that most of the NA probably would fall into the Rural bar.\n\nThis graph is the same as the one above but for SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. Here, overall, the proportions are lower which implies that education in sub-saharan Africa is not as good as education in Northern Africa. Also, there is a bigger difference between the urban and rural bar here.\n\nThis graph shows the mean primary completion rate for all of the North African countries.\n\nThis graph shows the mean primary school completion rate of all sub-saharan African countries. \n\nThis shows the number of observations for each Latin American country. It is definitely worth noting that countries like LCA and BRB do not have nearly as much data as the other countries. This should be noted for the entirety of our project.\n\nThis is a quick linear regression model we made. There is a relatively strong linear relationships between mean education years for 20-24 year olds and the mean primary completion rate. Note that this is grouped by country. The r-square is 0.72999 which indicated our model relative strong.\n\nThis is a residual plot. The residuals are relatively randomly distributed around y= 0, which means our model is doing a pretty good job of fitting the data. However, it is definitely worth noting that this is an extremely simple 1 variable and our models will require a lot more fine-tuning when they get more advanced."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

In our project, we want to discuss the relationship between race and education. Recognizing our topic is full of sensitivity and complexity, we will ensure our analysis is fair without reinforcing any stereotypes to some races and regions. In order to follow beneficence, we will be meticulous in how data is interpreted and presented, and avoid making incorrect or harmful interpretations. Our data set we chose actually aligns with the principles. For example, the original data can be accessed through the websites of the Global Education Monitoring Report and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The website is accessible for all communities and it follows the principle of justice: return data and research results to community members in a form they can use. Concurrently, it also meets transparency, because to adhere to this principle, it would entail providing comprehensive metadata and ensuring easy access to data documentation. However, our dataset encompasses numerous variables, not all of which are pertinent to our analysis.  The presence of superfluous information poses a risk of leading to incorrect conclusions or oversimplifications. Additionally, there may be challenges due to our limited capacity to fully analyze the breadth of data available. By acknowledging these limitations and proceeding with caution, we aim to uphold the principles throughout our research."

In our previous posts, we have only use simply region and elementary education level and building simple regression just to see whether the data make sense to us. After verifying the potential answer we will get, we also want to add our variable to help building the regression.\nOur analysis sought to reveal the mean years of education across different categorizations such as location (urban vs. rural), sex (male vs. female), and more. Utilizing ggplot2, we visualized these differences, which unveiled significant disparities. For instance, urban areas consistently showed higher educational attainment than rural counterparts, with Europe leading in educational years and Africa lagging behind."

    "text": "Dataset 1:Weekly United States COVID-19 Racial Data By State, April 12, 2020 to March 7, 2021\nURL: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.7272/Q6TT4P68\nThe dataset contains 212,969 rows and 86 columns.The dataset in question originates from a joint effort by the COVID Tracking Project and Boston University’s Center for Antiracist Research. It has been actively compiled since April 12, 2020, with updates being made twice weekly. The data is sourced from the official public health websites of various states and territories, with the collection process being carried out by volunteers, whose names have been provided. The dataset comprises 54 columns and includes 5320 data points. One notable limitation of the dataset is the inconsistency in reporting the ethnicity data across different states, particularly regarding the categorization of Hispanic or Latino races—some states include this data while others do not. There are 13 columns dedicated to documenting COVID-19 cases across different ethnicities, but there are redundancies, such as the columns for Cases_Latinx and Cases_Ethnicity_Hispanic, which appear to contain similar, if not identical, data. Additionally, the dataset includes 13 columns each for deaths, hospitalizations, and total cases, all disaggregated by ethnicity. However, these sections have many missing entries, which could pose challenges for data cleaning and further analysis.\nQuestions want to answer based on the dataset: -Does the hospitalizations rate affect the deaths rate? -Which ethnicity or group of ethnicities has the highest deaths rate? - Is there a correlation between the hospitalization rate and the death rate due to COVID-19, and if so, how strong is this relationship? -Does the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 differ significantly among ethnic groups, and what might this reveal about access to healthcare or disease severity? - How have hospitalization and death rates evolved over time for each ethnicity, and are there noticeable trends or patterns? - Are there regional variations in the death and hospitalization rates among different ethnicities, and what might this indicate about local public health policies?\nDataset 2: Ethnicity disparities in school in United States URL: https://www.education-inequalities.org/countries/united-states The dataset provided by the World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) tracks educational disparities across various countries, including the United States. From the 212,969 rows and 86 columns, it provides data on education outcomes differentiated by wealth, gender, ethnicity, and location, among other factors. This database can be significant for analyzing racial disparities in education. Meanwhile, the dataset provides numerous variables such as income, region, and completions of education which enable us to perform variable selection to find the best variable to show the correlation between racial disparities and education. We will likely face difficulties while cleaning the data since the dataset is relatively large with numerous outliers. Question want to answer based on the dataset: -How do educational outcomes vary by region and demographic groups in the USA?\n-How have educational outcomes been affected by race in the dataset?\nDataset 3: US Police Shootings URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings?resource=download There are 4896 rows and 15 columns for this dataset. This data was collected from Kaggle amidst the covid 19 pandemic when many hate crimes directed towards specific races were happening. The dataset is consisted of 4896 rows and 15 columns.One challenge that we may face with this dataset is that it is on the smaller side. 5,000 rows is not necessarily small, but it is definitely not large either. If we want to conduct a very reliable study, it may be worth considering finding a dataset with more rows. Another problem that we may run into is that it will be difficult to assess whether a police killing was justified or not if we do not have more description on the crime. For example, if there was a column that described how long the altercation lasted, it may provide more insight into whether or not the crime was justified.\nQuestions want to answer based on the dataset: -Does race and age play a factor in who gets killed by the police? -How are the shooting crime related to the race and age group"
